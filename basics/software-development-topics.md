## Agile Development
Agile Development is an umbrella term for several iterative and incremental software development methodologies. The most popular agile methodologies include :
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Scrum
- Crystal
- Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
- Lean Development
- Feature-Driven Development (FDD).

### Extreme Programming (XP) 
This takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development. 
- New versions may be built several times per day;
- Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks;
- All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully
